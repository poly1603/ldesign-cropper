## Not Implemented (Out of Scope for This Phase)

### Phase 6: AI-Powered Features ⏸️
- ❌ Smart Crop Detection (requires TensorFlow.js)
- ❌ Background Removal (requires external ML library)
- ❌ Auto-Enhancement (requires ML models)

*Reason: These features require large external dependencies (TensorFlow.js, ML models) which would significantly increase bundle size. They can be added as optional plugins.*

### Phase 7: Drawing & Annotation Tools ⏸️
- ❌ Drawing Engine
- ❌ Drawing Tools (pen, shapes, text)
- ❌ Drawing Toolbar

*Reason: This is a complete feature set that would require extensive implementation. Can be a separate module/plugin.*

### Test Coverage
- ⚠️ Partial test coverage exists
- ❌ Comprehensive unit tests (80%+ coverage target)
- ❌ Integration tests
- ❌ Visual regression tests

*Reason: Testing is important but was deprioritized to focus on core functionality and optimization.*
